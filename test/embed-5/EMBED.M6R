        Context:
            Use the latest available stable version of puppeteer for rendering.

        Context:
            Use the latest available stable version of yargs for command line options.

        Context:
            Use the latest available stable version of yargs for command line options.

        Context:
            Use the latest available stable version of axios to handle the HTTP requests.

    Context: Rendering

        Context:
            Once the directory structure is in place and all old index.html files have been deleted, render all the pages.

        Context:
            The tool should parallelize rendering operations.

    Context: Retry Mechanism

        Context:
            Implement a retry mechanism for failed render attempts with a default of 3 retries.

        Context:
            The retry mechanism should be applied to invocations of puppeteer as well as for network failures.

        Context:
            Allow this to be configurable with the --max-retries parameter.

        Context:
            If a failure occurs, wait one second before attempting the retry.

        Context:
            The tool should exit with an error status if any page fails to render after retries.
