        Context:

        Context: Code quality

            Context:
                Use JSDoc annotations for all functions.
            Context:
                Use 4 spaces for indentation in the source code.
            Context:
                Where any functions may throw errors, include try/catch blocks to handle those error conditions.
            Context:
                For code style, do not use an "else" if the previous block in an if statement ends with a "return" statement.
