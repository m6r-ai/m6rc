Context: File management
    Context:
        Rendered pages should be saved in a specified output directory.

    Context:
        For each page, the directory structure should match the URL path, but should not include the hostname or any port number.

    Context:
        If the page does not have an explicit ".html" or ".htm" name then assume it is a directory and create a file "index.html" as the file name within that output directory.

        Given the tool is scanning URLs for the website https://davehudson.io, when the tool has found a URL
        https://davehudson.io/blog/post then the output file should be saved <output-directory>/blog/post/index.html,
        where <output-directory> is the path specified as the output directory.

    Context:
        If the output directory or any subdirectories do not exist then they should be created.  If creating the directories fails then emit a failure message to the console and exit with an error status.

    Context:
        Before attempting any to invoke puppeteer for a given URL, any previous output file that matches what will be the new output file must be deleted.
