        The output directory is defined by the non-optional --output command line parameter.
    Context:
        For each page, the directory structure should match the URL path, but should not include the hostname or any port number.
    Context:
        If the page does not have an explicit ".html" or ".htm" name then assume it is a directory and create a file "index.html" as the file name within that output directory.

        Given the tool is scanning URLs for the website https://davehudson.io, when the tool has found a URL
        https://davehudson.io/blog/post, then The output file should be saved

    Context:
        If the output directory or any subdirectories do not exist then they should be created.  If creating the directories fails then emit a failure message to the console and exit with an error status.
